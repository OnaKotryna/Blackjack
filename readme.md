# Blackjack

Single Player Blackjack game

Here are the basic rules of blackjack:

- The goal of the game is to have a hand with a higher total value than the dealer's hand without exceeding 21.
- Aces are worth 1 or 11, face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are worth 10, and all other cards are worth their face value.
- At the start of the game, a player is dealt two cards face up, and the dealer is dealt one card face up and one card face down.
- Player can choose to "hit" to receive an additional card or "stand" to keep their current hand. Player can continue to hit until they decide to stand or a hand exceeds 21, resulting in a "bust".
- After player has completed turns, the dealer reveals their face-down card and must continue to hit until they have a total of 17 or higher.

Who wins?

- Player wins if they have higher hand without exceeding 21 than the dealer or the dealer busts.
- Dealer wins if they have higher hand without exceeding 21 than the player or the player busts.
- If a player's first two cards have a total value of 21 (an Ace and a 10 or face card), they have a "blackjack" and win immediately, unless the dealer also has a blackjack, resulting in a tie or "push".
